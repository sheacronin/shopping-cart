# Shopping Cart

This project uses `react-router-dom` to practice routing a React app. The user can browse different categories of items and add their selected quantity to their cart. The items in the cart can then be viewed.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
